### Bitcoin Whitepaper

#### 1.	What problem did Bitcoin solve? How important is the invention of Bitcoin? 
Bitcoin solves the weaknesses of traditional electronic payments, like involving third parties, the centralization system, which increases transaction costs and limits the minimum practical transaction size. Also the requirement of more personal information to insure the trust on that transactions. While Bitcoin can provide that trust as a blockchain that much secure. And anyone can use it freely on the network.

#### 2.	How would you explain a blockchain to someone who doesn't know what it is?
It is a super ledger that has records of immutable transactions in blocks. These transactions are distributed across the entire network. It is called a blockchain because these blocks are bound to each other as a chain, using cryptographic principles.

#### 3.	Do you think Bitcoin could one day be a world reserve currency? Why or why not?
Hard to say, but I think it will not, at least in the short run. Because it doesn't have a pretty stable value, if i reserve something, sure i want it to be worth above it's value in the future. Bitcoin is highly volatile, sensitive to many influences, and carries a high risk.
